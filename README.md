## Introduction

Tipping behavior significantly impacts the earnings of drivers. Understanding and predicting tipping patterns can help drivers optimize their rides and provide better service. This project automates the prediction of tipping behavior based on historical ride data, offering valuable insights for the ride service industry.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Ride service trip data from 2017.
- **Content**: The dataset includes:
  - Pickup and drop-off locations.
  - Payment types.
  - Fare amounts, tips, and total costs.
  - Ride durations and distances.
- **Target**: Binary classification of customers as generous tippers (tipping â‰¥20%) or not.

## Feature Engineering

Features used include:

- **Tip Percentage**: Calculated as `tip_amount / (total_amount - tip_amount)`.
- **Time of Day**: Categorized into AM rush, daytime, PM rush, and nighttime.
- **Day of the Week**: Extracted from pickup datetime.
- **Vendor and Location IDs**: Encoded as categorical features.

## Model Architecture

The project employs two machine learning models for prediction:

### Random Forest Classifier

- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
- Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy.

### XGBoost Classifier

- Optimized for binary classification with advanced hyperparameter tuning.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TipPredict.git
cd TipPredict
```

### Run the Jupyter Notebook

Open `notebooks/modeling.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to:

- Explore the data.
- Train and evaluate the models.

### Inference

To test the model:

- Load the dataset or new data.
- Run the prediction cells to classify tipping behavior.

## Results

The model achieves robust performance on the test set:

- **Random Forest**:
  - F1 Score: 0.75
  - Accuracy: 0.69
- **XGBoost**:
  - F1 Score: 0.74
  - Accuracy: 0.68

### Visualizations

- **Confusion Matrix**:


## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements include:

- **Larger Dataset**: Incorporate additional data to improve model robustness.
- **Additional Features**: Engineer more features, such as customer behavior history.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploy the model as a web or mobile app for real-time predictions.
